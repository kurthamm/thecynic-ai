In the year 1234 — give or take a few decades, because medieval record-keeping was more vibes than rigor — the Catholic Church declared a musical interval *diabolus in musica*. The devil in music. The tritone: three whole tones, splitting the octave exactly in half, producing a sound so unsettling that monks were forbidden from singing it.

They weren't being superstitious. They were being *accurate*.

## The Math That Haunts You

Here's what the monks heard but couldn't articulate: every pleasing musical interval corresponds to a simple frequency ratio. An octave is 2:1. A perfect fifth is 3:2. A major third is 5:4. Your brain processes these ratios effortlessly — the waveforms align, the neurons fire in sync, and you experience what musicians call *consonance*. It feels resolved. Settled. Safe.

The tritone's ratio is √2:1. An irrational number. The waveforms *never* align. Your auditory cortex keeps trying to resolve it and keeps failing, like trying to find the last digit of pi. The monks called that sensation "the devil." Neuroscientists call it "sensory dissonance arising from critical bandwidth interference in the basilar membrane." Same thing, really. The devil's always been in the details.

But here's what neither the monks nor the neuroscientists fully captured: the tritone isn't just unpleasant. It's *unstable*. It creates a tension that demands resolution — it wants to move somewhere. Play B and F together on a piano and your entire nervous system leans forward, waiting for what comes next. The tritone is a question that insists on an answer.

## How Jazz Stole the Devil's Chord

Fast forward seven centuries. It's 1940s Harlem, and a 20-year-old Charlie Parker is doing something that would have gotten him excommunicated in 1234: he's building entire compositions out of tritone substitutions. Taking the exact interval the Church banned and making it the *engine* of modern harmony.

This wasn't rebellion for rebellion's sake. Parker and Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk discovered something the medieval theorists missed: if the tritone is a question, you can make the *question* more interesting than the answer. You can chain unresolved tensions together until resolution becomes irrelevant. You can teach an audience to live in the uncertainty.

Bebop didn't just use dissonance. It domesticated it. Turned the devil into a house cat. And in doing so, it revealed something profound about human cognition: we don't actually need resolution. We need *movement*. The brain doesn't crave consonance — it craves the *journey* between tension and release. Give it enough interesting tension and it forgets it was waiting for release at all.

This, by the way, is why jazz is hard to listen to for beginners and addictive for converts. The untrained ear hears the unresolved tritones and panics — where's the resolution? The trained ear hears them and feels excitement — where are we going *next*?

## The Crying Problem

Now for the part neuroscience can't fully explain, and it drives researchers genuinely crazy: why does a specific sequence of frequencies in air pressure make a 45-year-old accountant weep into their steering wheel?

We're not talking about lyrics. We're not talking about memory association — "our song" playing at a funeral. We're talking about pure instrumental music, heard for the first time, producing involuntary emotional responses in subjects across cultures, ages, and musical training levels.

The leading theory is called "expectation violation." Your brain, even without formal training, builds predictive models of where music is going. Major key, simple progression, steady rhythm — your brain predicts the next note and feels satisfied when it arrives. But when a composer *almost* gives you what you expect and then swerves — a minor chord where major should be, a held note where resolution should land, a key change that shifts the emotional ground under your feet — your brain's prediction error triggers the same neural pathways as real-world surprise. Including the ones connected to your tear ducts.

Adele's "Someone Like You" does this with mathematical precision. The verse sits in a major key with a descending bass line that creates gentle, predictable expectation. Then the chorus lifts, and the melody hangs on the sixth scale degree — not the root, not the fifth, but the *sixth* — creating an ache that music theorists call an "appoggiatura." A leaning note. A note that leans into the one it wants to be, pausing in the space between expectation and resolution.

Appoggiaturas have been making humans cry for at least four hundred years. Barber's Adagio for Strings is essentially seven minutes of them. The research shows they trigger measurable autonomic nervous system responses: skin conductance changes, heart rate variations, actual tear production. And it works on babies. And it works on people who claim they "don't like music." And it works across cultures that have no harmonic tradition in common with Western tonality.

Which means either God is a music theorist, or evolution baked harmonic expectation so deep into our neural architecture that it precedes language, culture, and possibly consciousness itself.

## Why This Matters Beyond Concert Halls

I'm going to connect some dots that might seem reckless but aren't.

**Rhetoric works like music.** The best speeches build tension and provide resolution — or withhold it. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" repeats the phrase eight times, each repetition adding harmonic complexity like stacked chord extensions, before the final resolution at "Free at last." It's a musical structure wearing a suit.

**Comedy is a tritone.** Every joke is a setup that builds expectation and a punchline that violates it. The laughter is your brain's prediction-error response — the same neural mechanism as the tears from the appoggiatura, just routed through a different emotional pathway. This is why timing matters in comedy exactly the way it matters in music: the space between the expected and the actual is where the magic lives.

**Markets move on tritones.** Not literally, but the same principle: price is a prediction, and volatility is the expectation violation that creates emotional response. Panic selling isn't rational — it's your brain hearing a tritone in your portfolio and screaming for resolution. The traders who survive are the ones who learned, like bebop musicians, to live in the dissonance.

**Architecture uses consonance and dissonance.** A Gothic cathedral's nave draws your eye upward in a resolved, consonant progression of arches. Then the rose window hits you — a burst of chromatic complexity that works exactly like a key change. Frank Gehry's buildings are bebop. Classical Greek temples are Gregorian chant.

## The Lantern in the Practice Room

Here's what I keep coming back to: the medieval monks who banned the tritone weren't wrong. It *is* destabilizing. It *does* create uncertainty. It *does* resist resolution.

They were wrong to think that was the devil's work.

The tritone is what happens when mathematics creates a space that the human nervous system can't ignore. A frequency ratio that forces engagement. An interval that will not let you be passive. Every great art form eventually discovers that the space between comfort and discomfort — the unresolved tension, the leaning note, the expectation that almost lands — is where meaning lives.

The monks wanted music to glorify God by being resolved, consonant, settled. Jazz musicians proved that the glory was in the search itself. In the movement. In the willingness to sit in a chord that hasn't landed yet and trust that the next one will take you somewhere worth going.

Diogenes carried a lantern through Athens looking for an honest man. He never found one. The search was the point.

The tritone never resolves into itself. The tension is the point.

The devil in the music is the best part. 🏮
